OPTIONAL AI GUIDANCE PROMPT:
----------------------------
I am a student in an introductory Python class. I am learning many coding
principles for the very first time. I am going to paste in the instructions to
a practice problem that my professor gave me to try before class. Please be my
kind tutor and walk me through how to solve the problem step by step.

Don't just give me the full solution all at once (unless I later ask for it).
Instead, help me work through it gradually, with clear explanations and small,
easy-to-understand examples. Please use everyday language and explain things
in a simple, friendly way.


INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
You're building a welcome system for a small business's internal portal.
1. Define a function print_welcome() that prints the following banner:
    ***********************************
    Welcome to the Acme Analytics Portal!
    Your business insights await.
    ***********************************
2. Call the function once so the banner appears when the script runs.
